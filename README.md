# nuimo-openhab-python (Pre-Alpha)

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/nuimo-openhab-python/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/nuimo-openhab-python/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/nuimo-openhab-python/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

An application based on [getsenic/nuimo-linux-python](https://github.com/getsenic/nuimo-linux-python) to use your Nuimo as a UI for OpenHab! This project is in a very early state of development - so please be prepared that the configuration capabilities are quite limited at the moment and that there will be bugs and unexpected behaviour.

## Installation

### Method 1: Install from source

1. Make sure bluez version 5.44 or higher  is installed. Normally, you can check your bluez version by executing this command: `bluetoothd --version`. On [getsenic/nuimo-linux-python](https://github.com/getsenic/nuimo-linux-python), you can find instructions how to install bluez from source on a Debian system (as bluez is currently only available at older versions on most Linux distributions).
1. `git clone https://github.com/pfink/nuimo-openhab-python`
1. Adjust *config.example.yml* to your needs and rename it to *config.yml*
1. Optionally, you can move config.yml to another location (e.g. */etc/nuimo-openhab/config.yml*). If you do so, you have to specify that path via the environment variable `NUIMO_OPENHAB_CONFIG_PATH`.
1. Install dependencies (the following commands are examples for a Debian-based system):
    1. `apt-get install python3-pip python3-dbus python3-gi python3-yaml`
    1. `pip3 install -r nuimo-openhab-python/requirements.txt`


### Method 2: Docker container for the Raspberry Pi (recommended)

If you want to install this app on Raspberry Pi, I would recommend to use the following docker image to get started instead of the instruction above as it saves you the work to build a recent bluez version on your own: [pfink/nuimo-raspbian-docker](https://github.com/pfink/nuimo-raspbian-docker)

Please be aware that despite this installation method is easier and less error-prone than Method 1, it will have the consequence that you can't use the same bluetooth adapter that you use for nuimo integration on the host system anymore. So you have to disable the adapter that you want to use for nuimo integration on the host system first, or alternatively, stop the bluetooth service on the host system (`service bluetooth stop`).

1. Install docker: `curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh`
1. Download & create container:`docker create --privileged --net=host --name=nuimo-openhab -v /etc/nuimo-openhab:/etc/nuimo-openhab pfink2/rpi-nuimo-openhab`
1. Copy *config.yml* template to host (can be done either manually or shorthand by the following command): `mkdir -p /etc/nuimo-openhab && docker cp nuimo-openhab:/opt/nuimo-openhab-python/config.example.yml /etc/nuimo-openhab/config.yml`
1. Adjust configuration file under */etc/nuimo-openhab/config.yml* to your needs.

## OpenHab Configuration

Before you start the App, you should configure the OpenHab-side to define which items you want to control with your Nuimo.

1. Create a group item with the name *Nuimo* on your OpenHab and add items you want to control with the Nuimo to that Group.
1. Icons are not supported yet. As a "dirty workaround", you have to use labels for your items to define the icons showed on the 9x9 Nuimo LED matrix. The label have to be a string of the length of 81 chars (9x9) and consist of asterisks(`*`) for led=on and spaces (` `) for led=off.

Please find an example configuration below:

```
Group Nuimo

Group:String:AVG S "**********        *        *        *********        *        *        **********" (Nuimo)
Group:String:AVG W "*       **       **       **       **   *   **  * *  ** *   * ***     ***       *" (Nuimo)
Group:String:AVG B "******** *       **       **      * *******  *      * *       **       ********* " (Nuimo)
```

This will define 3 group items (`S`, `W` and `B`) that can be controlled via Nuimo (you don't have to use group items, normal items will also work). Each "real item" you add to one of those 3 groups will receive the commands sent via the nuimo to that particular group.

## Start the application

### Installed from source

```
cd nuimo-openhab-python
python3 main.py
```

### Docker container

```
docker start nuimo-openhab
```

## Usage

Swipe up and down to navigate between the items. Swipe left and right to switch in our out of a group. Using the "turning knob" will always send Dimmer commands (from 0 to 100) - this can only work, if the item you bound holds a dimmer state (Number from 0 to 100). Other gestures will trigger OpenHab commands as configured within the *config.yml*.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support icon sets
- [ ] Nuimo should be bound on a sitemap instead to the *Nuimo* group item. This will make the configuration more flexible and robust.
- [x] It should be possible to "jump into" a group so that you can navigate with the Nuimo similar to other UIs
- [ ] Improve stability & robustness
